Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in Python
Overview
This Python script implements a basic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using a signature-based detection approach. The IDS analyzes log entries to identify potential intrusion attempts based on known malicious patterns (signatures).

Features
Signature-based detection of intrusion attempts.
Customizable list of malicious patterns (signatures).
Support for analyzing log entries from various sources.
How it Works
Signature Definition: The IDS uses a list of known malicious patterns (signatures) defined as regular expressions (regex). These patterns represent common attack strings or sequences found in log entries.

Detection Process: The detect_intrusion function analyzes each log entry to determine if it contains any of the malicious patterns defined in the signature list. If a match is found, indicating a suspicious pattern, the function returns True, indicating that an intrusion is detected.

Log Entry Analysis: Example log entries are provided to simulate log data. These entries represent events or actions that occur within a system or network, such as user logins, SQL queries, or HTTP requests.

Detection Output: The script iterates through the example log entries provided within the script and prints messages indicating whether intrusions are detected or not.

Usage
Installation: No installation is required. Simply clone or download the Python script (intrusion_detection.py) to your local machine.

Execution: Execute the script by running the following command in a terminal:

bash
Copy code
python intrusion_detection.py
Replace intrusion_detection.py with the actual filename of the Python script if it's different.

Output: The script will analyze the example log entries provided within the script and print messages indicating whether intrusions are detected or not.

Customization
Adding Signatures: You can customize the list of known malicious patterns (signatures) by modifying the malicious_patterns list in the script. Add new patterns as regular expressions to expand the detection capabilities.

Log Entry Simulation: Replace the example log entries with real log data from your environment to analyze actual events and detect intrusions.
