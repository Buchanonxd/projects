Port Scanner
Overview
This Python script is designed to perform port scanning on a specified IP address within a given range of ports. It utilizes the socket module to establish TCP connections to each port and determine whether it is open, closed, or filtered.

Features
Scans a range of ports on a specified IP address.
Supports customization of the port range and connection timeout.
Provides detailed information about each scanned port (open, closed, or filtered).
Handles errors and exceptions during the scanning process.
Usage
Installation: No installation is required. Simply clone or download the Python script portscanner.py to your local machine.

Execution: Execute the script by running the command:

Copy code
python portscanner.py
Replace "your ip address" with the IP address you want to scan. You can also adjust the start_port and end_port parameters within the script to define the range of ports you want to scan.

Output: The script will display the status of each scanned port, indicating whether it is open, closed, or filtered. Once the scan is complete, it will provide a summary of the total number of open ports found.

Parameters
ip: The IP address to scan.
start_port: The starting port number for the scan (default is 1).
end_port: The ending port number for the scan (default is 1024).
timeout: The timeout in seconds for each connection attempt (default is 0.1).
Notes
Permission: Ensure that you have proper authorization before conducting a port scan. Unauthorized port scanning may violate network policies and regulations.
Network Security: Use this script responsibly and only on networks and systems for which you have permission to perform scanning activities.
